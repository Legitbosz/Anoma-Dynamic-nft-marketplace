## 🚩 Core Problems with Traditional NFT Marketplaces  

- **Inefficient Price Discovery** – Static listings often lead to overpriced or underpriced NFTs.  
- **Temporal Mismatch** – Buyers and sellers miss each other due to timing.  
- **Limited Intent Expression** – Users can only place simple buy/sell orders, with no support for complex strategies.  
- **High Gas Costs** – Failed bids and outbids waste gas and time.

## 💡 What Intent Matching Solves  

- **Intelligent Price Discovery** – Dynamic pricing based on demand, volatility, and historical trends.  
- **Cross-Temporal Matching** – Connect buyers/sellers across time; intents can remain active until matched.  
- **Complex Strategy Execution** – Define intents like *“Buy rare NFTs under X ETH”* or *“Sell gradually over time.”*  
- **Reduced Gas Usage** – Off-chain matching minimizes failed transactions before on-chain execution.
